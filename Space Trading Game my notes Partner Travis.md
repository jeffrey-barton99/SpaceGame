Learning Objectives
Classes and objects
working with git as a team 
learning/working git process
working git merge conflicts
reccomended to have/use good tests.  This will help merge conflicts.


Requirements
-Start on earth
-Have at least 5 planets w/player can travel
-Player at start of game should be 18 yo and have a ship(ability to gain a ship) and a small amount of starting currency (credits)
-Ends when player reaches end goal(specific goal up to me) or reaches age 60

-Primary goal is to amass wealth by trading goods/services(piracy is a service) among planets
-You write the story
-Game should have "good" and "bad" ending, optionally a separate "age out" ending.
-Game should have compelling (roughly speeking) story
-User interface should be a TUI buld as a console application

-Travel between planets should follow "warp speed" calculation (I will provide)
-Planets should be arranged on a 2d X/Y coordinate system, such that distance between planets are
provided by the pythagorean therom
-Earth should be at the origin (x = 0, y = 0)
-One of the remaining 4 (min) planets should be alpha proxima 1 (4.7light years fr earth (x= ~4.7, y = 0))
-Travel between planets should occur at a user-defined speed specified in warp units, potentially limited by ship speeed or other conditions.
-Ships ahve a specified capacity which can not be exceeded

#Stretch Goals
-Conditions which allow faster than normal travel(ship upgrades, natural phenomena [wormhole], stargate,etc.)
-Space ship flying mini game(asteroid field)
-Space ships sonsume fuel when travelling

#Warp equation
-Given Warp speed (w) with non-inclusive bonds of 0 and 10, velocity in multiples of the speed of light = W^(10/3) + (10-w)^(-11/3).
